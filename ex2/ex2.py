# MAIN EXERCISE
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this")  # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")

# STUDY DRILLS
# 1. did i knew about the # character? 
# yes, it comments lines and its name is octothorpe or pound character
# 2. to 4. basically error checking, i had no problem with it; 
# it was suggested to read code backward cause it's a trick to make your brain 
# not attach meaning to each part of the code and rethink the problem
